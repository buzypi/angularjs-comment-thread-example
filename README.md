AngularJS Comments Thread Example
=================================

This snippet shows the power of AngularJS's use of recursive templates to render composite data like a comments thread. A comments thread is a good example as it has both lists and maps and also is recursive by nature.

The example also shows the data-binding abilities and controllers which are kept completely independent of presentation (UI) code.
